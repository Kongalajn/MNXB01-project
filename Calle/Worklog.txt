Started playing with the code and ended up basically implementing the
tempOnDay function. The function can currently only read .dat files, specifically
.dat files that are structured in the way the provided .dat file with
data from Uppsala is. 
The code is tested and works fine as far as I can tell it is not yet 
commented however.

Implemented a second function which can read file of the format .csv.
As before the code is tested and seems to be working as intended but 
is not yet commented.

Managed to merge the two functions into a single function capable of 
reading both the .csv files aswell as the .dat file. Also added an error
message if the loaded file is of the wrong format i.e not a .dat or .csv 
file. Finally I made the output look a little nicer with it now displaying
which date we are looking at. The code is still not commented but is working
fine with the files I have teste.
