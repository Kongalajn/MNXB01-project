Started playing with the code and ended up basically implementing the
tempOnDay function. The function can currently only read .dat files, specifically
.dat files that are structured in the way the provided .dat file with
data from Uppsala is. 
The code is tested and works fine as far as I can tell it is not yet 
commented however.

Adds a method called tempSpectrogram() that so far only can read the data from the uppsala file. It makes a 2d graph with the PCOL option but it can be changed to a SURF1 or whatever you feel like BUT it takes forever to draw the surfacegraphs.

Will start work on a way of doing the same with the other data files.
