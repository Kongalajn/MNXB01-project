Started playing with the code and ended up basically implementing the
tempOnDay function. The function can currently only read .dat files, specifically
.dat files that are structured in the way the provided .dat file with
data from Uppsala is. 
The code is tested and works fine as far as I can tell it is not yet 
commented however.

Implemented a second function which can read file of the format .csv.
As before the code is tested and seems to be working as intended but 
is not yet commented.
