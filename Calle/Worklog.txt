Started playing with the code and ended up basically implementing the
tempOnDay function. The function can currently only read .dat files, specifically
.dat files that are structured in the way the provided .dat file with
data from Uppsala is. 
The code is tested and works fine as far as I can tell it is not yet 
commented however.

Implemented a second function which can read file of the format .csv.
As before the code is tested and seems to be working as intended but 
is not yet commented.

Managed to merge the two functions into a single function capable of 
reading both the .csv files aswell as the .dat file. Also added an error
message if the loaded file is of the wrong format i.e not a .dat or .csv 
file. Finally I made the output look a little nicer with it now displaying
which date we are looking at. The code is still not commented but is working
fine with the files I have tested.

Fixed an issue with the code not being able to read all .csv files as they
are not all formated precisely the same. Had to remove stod() and to_string()
as they are not available pre c++11 and my project partners are using an earlier
version. I am now using stringstream to do these operations instead. Also had to 
change the argument of when loading the file with ifstream to a const char instead
of a string which again had to do with me using c++11. Made some small changes to 
the bash output and added a title to the histogram. Added an error message if the 
path does not lead to a .csv or .dat file. Code is working fine and is semi-commented.
