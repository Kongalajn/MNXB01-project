Started playing with the code and ended up basically implementing the
tempOnDay function. The function can currently only read .dat files, specifically
.dat files that are structured in the way the provided .dat file with
data from Uppsala is. 
The code is tested and works fine as far as I can tell it is not yet 
commented however.

Adds a method called tempSpectrogram() that so far only can read the data from the uppsala file. It makes a 2d graph with the PCOL option but it can be changed to a SURF1 or whatever you feel like BUT it takes forever to draw the surfacegraphs.

Will start work on a way of doing the same with the other data files.

----------------------

The method tempSpectrogram has changed name to DataView3D.
The DataView3D(Int_t startYear, Int_t endYear, bool isUppsala, Int_t startTime=666, Int_t endTime=666)
plots a 2D/3D graph that shows the data points in a window specified by the user.
The first two arguments specify between which year to look, the third argument is true if
you want to look at the uppsala data, else its false.
The two last arguments are only for the CSV files. There you can specify which timewindow
of the day you want to view datapoints from.

There seems to be some very mysterious problem with how the range of the axis are set, sometimes
it works and sometimes it doesnt. I have not been able to figure out why this is. 
Also, for some reason the graph can only show points, if I try to make a surface plot it becomes a flat surface at 0...
