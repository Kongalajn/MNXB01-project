Attempts to make code work//Alex Wyke

8/11
Make basic pseudocode - nothing advanced, but idea grows. Main problem: getting file to read. How to extract dates
as anything but strings? Logically made, but hard to crack.

9/11
Code that is essentially nothing but errors created - basic idea. Make monthday offset - 
for each passing month, add the previous month's days to the total, so you end up with day of year.
Realize I don't need to concern myself with file ending as previously thought - as long as data structure
is the same, .dat and .csv can be read without problem. Can probably read different with some minor modification.
Later problem.

getline to extract strings from datafile - how to make into floats and ints?
Make solid way to handle iteration - find each hottest/coldest day and iterate day from this.
Added histograms, made 2 that combine into a total for presentation - does not yet work.

11/11-12/11
Scrap previous hottest/coldest loops. Realized it only increased days on days that a new record is reached.
Got help, turned getline to old C code to turn strings as elements in vector into integers.
