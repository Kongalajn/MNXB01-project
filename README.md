We write anything else helpful here - links to read, example data, etc.
Communication should be done primarily through some other means, though - facebook, email, etc. As this is instanced via email we can start there. We should organize who starts on what parts, and set some deadlines for them - I recommend a soft deadline for everything on the 9th of November. //Alex W
